    "\n",
    "Features\n",
    "- Rules - progressively updated \n",
    "- User-interface for deciding number of players\n",
    "- Automatically generate (n) number of lists from user input ie. number of players (List of lists)\n",
    "- Game Logic (Procedural Programing not focused on OOP yet!)\n",
    "- Score Analysis (Lists) and accumulation final score\n",
    "- Using the zip() & dict () functions to input our data into a dictionary \n",
    "- Input this dictionary into Pandas Dataframe & generating descriptive statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Objectives for Next Phases of CODE !\n",
    "- Regarding game logic implement a while loop that will hold our GAME-LOGIC and hence mitigate REPEATED CODE\n",
    "- Experiment with MAtplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly\n",
    "- Delve into the realms of OOP and transfer our CODE which has been coded with a PROCEDURAL architecture into Object Orineted Programing !"
